## Clustering

Main motive of this program is to find useful patterns in the "Iris.csv" dataset using clustering algorithms. Here two clustering Algorithms have been implemented :-
1. K-Mean Clustering - elbow method is used to find clusters in the data.
2. Hierarchical Clustering - dendogram method is used to find useful pattern in the datas available.
